To get developing:
---

Clone the repo
	git clone https://github.com/leetobin/firebrick.git 
	(this should create a firebrick directory with source files)

Build buildroot et al.
	cd firebrick/buildroot
	make (and wait about 25mins)

Build coreboot with the firebrick kernel+initfs as payload
	cd (../../)firebrick/coreboot
	make (and wait about 5mins)

Then you can flash your new coreboot bios file (firebrick/coreboot/build/coreboot.com) into the Asrock motherboard
