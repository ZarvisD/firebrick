Firebrick
---

Software for the open source hardware write-blocker/imager.

FIREBrick features:
*Autonomous disk imaging at speeds of up to 5Gb per minute (disk dependent)
*FireWire write blocker function
*Stand-alone version supports storage mirroring and encryption
*Portable – fits in a small HTPC case, including display
*Free, open source firmware
*Can be fully customized to the needs of specific departments
*Adheres to NIST Computer Forensic Tool Testing protocols

To build a FIREBrick you need:

*AsRock E350M1 Motherboard
*2Gb DDR3 Desktop RAM (1333 or 1066)
*Dynamode PCIX3FW 3-Port Firewire PCIe
*An LCD2USB 20×4 display. You can buy it from Lcdmodkit or you can make one yourself according to these instructions.
*At least three SATA cables – two for the internal RAIDed drives + one long SATA cable for connecting FIREBrick to the target.
*You will need a case of your choice that fits a mini-ITX (pretty much any case) and a PSU with at least three SATA Power connectors (200W is quite enough).

Note: You will also need two equal-sized HDDs for internal RAID array storage.
